# DragNDropUI
This is a generic ui with buttons which can be dragged arround and anchor to any tab 
below with simply clicking and dragging around the button.

Afterwards the same item that was anchored to a tab can be dragged again to either put it
in another tab or drop it outside and destroy it.
